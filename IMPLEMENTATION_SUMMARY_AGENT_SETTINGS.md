# Implementation Summary: Centralized Agent Contact Settings

## Overview
Successfully implemented centralized management of agent contact/notification endpoints in the main bot's admin console. Child agents now operate in read-only mode for contact settings with enhanced data security.

## Key Features Delivered

### 1. Main Bot Admin Panel
- **New Admin Interface**: Added "üõ† ‰ª£ÁêÜËÅîÁ≥ªÊñπÂºèËÆæÁΩÆ" in agent management panel
- **Managed Settings**:
  - Customer service contacts (supports multiple @handles)
  - Official channel (@channel or https link)
  - Restock notification group (@group or invite link)
  - Tutorial link (http(s):// URLs)
  - Notification channel ID (numeric or @username)
  - Notification group ID (numeric or @username)
- **Features**:
  - Button-driven setting flows
  - Input validation (URLs, numeric IDs)
  - Support for clearing settings with "Ê∏ÖÈô§" command
  - Immediate reflection in child agents

### 2. Child Agent Read-Only Mode
- **Display**: All contact settings visible in read-only format
- **Removed**: Contact editing buttons (agent_cfg_* handlers)
- **Preserved**: Markup settings, withdrawals, analytics, custom link buttons
- **User Experience**: Clear note explaining admin-managed settings

### 3. Security Enhancements
- **New Module**: `services/security.py` with comprehensive redaction utilities
- **Functions**:
  - `redact_order_payload()` - Removes sensitive customer data
  - `is_agent_context()` - Detects child agent context
  - `should_block_download()` - Blocks file access for child agents
  - `get_permission_denied_message()` - Localized permission messages
- **Redacted Fields**: credentials, files, passwords, secrets, deliverables, sessions, JSON, tokens, keys
- **Preserved Fields**: product metadata (name, price, quantity, timestamps)

### 4. Notification System
- **Compatibility**: Existing notification flows unchanged
- **Enhancements**: Added notify_group_id support alongside notify_channel_id
- **Helper Functions**: `get_notify_group_id_for_child()` for group notifications
- **Future-Ready**: Documented extension point for message_thread_id (topic groups)
